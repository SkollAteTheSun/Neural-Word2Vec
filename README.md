# Neural-Word2Vec
Neural network of direct distribution

Build classifiers to assess the sentiment of texts. Train models on a dataset from the RuTweetCorp corpus
To solve the problem, it is necessary to use 2 sets of features:
  1. Word2vec-features.
  2. Pre-trained Word2vec features.
For each set of features, build a classifier using a feed-forward neural network using at least two different options for each item:
  1. Select activation function
  2. Choice of loss function
  3. Scale initialization
  4. Regularization
  5. Batch normalization
  6. Learning rate settings
